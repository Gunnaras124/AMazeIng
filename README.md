🧠 A-Maze-Ing
The Maze Game That Asks: “Did you win? Or are you just hallucinating?”

🎮 What Is This?
A-Maze-Ing is a Pygame-based spiritual journey disguised as a maze game.

It features:

A slowly oscillating wall for reasons no one understands

Time tracking so you can reflect on your regrets

A final level that questions your perception of reality

A player square that grows like your ego after reaching Level 3

💥 Gameplay
You are The Square.

Use WASD or arrow keys to guide your tiny rectangle of hope through walls of existential dread.

Complete Level 1 and Level 2 to reach Level 3, where:

The player square becomes obese

You’re congratulated...

...then immediately gaslit

🧱 Features
🟨 Level 1: A red hellscape. Don't touch the borders. The borders touch back.

🟨 Level 2: Now in yellow! Includes an animated vertical wall that expands and contracts for no reason except chaos.

🟧 Level 3: You “win” the game. Or do you? Displays total time taken—so you know how long you wasted here.

🧠 Developer Notes
The maze isn’t generated. It’s just... there.

The collision logic is built to punish overconfidence.

The resizable wall? That's art, my friend. Interactive art.

🏁 Ending Spoiler
Yes, you win.
But also no, you never really do.
The real maze... was the friends we confused along the way.

🧼 Final Words
This isn't just a game.
It's an experience.
A maze-themed fever dream.

Good luck.
You're gonna need it.
